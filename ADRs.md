Project architecture

Status: Proposed
Context:
Our current project dashboard frontend is built with React. We need to extend this application to support multiple dashboards (two or three) that can share configurations, components, logic, and features. We are considering three architectural approaches to achieve this: Monorepo, Microfrontend, and Monolithic Application. This ADR evaluates the pros and cons of each approach to determine the best fit for our requirements.
Decision:
We will compare the following architectural approaches:
Monorepo: A single repository containing multiple projects and libraries.
Microfrontend: Each dashboard as a separate frontend application.
Monolithic Application: All dashboards within a single application.
Monorepo Approach:
Pros:
Code Reusability: Shared configurations, components, and logic are easily accessible.
Simplified Dependency Management: Dependencies are managed in a single repository.
Consistency: Easier to maintain a consistent development environment and coding standards.
Collaborative Development: Improved collaboration as all code is in one place.
Cons:
Repository Size: The repository can become large and unwieldy.
Complexity: Managing multiple projects within a single repository can add complexity.
Build Times: Can lead to longer build times as the repository grows.
Microfrontend Approach:
Pros:
Independence: Each dashboard can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
Modularity: Clear separation of concerns between different dashboards.
Scalability: Easier to scale specific parts of the application as needed.
Flexibility: Different technologies and frameworks can be used for different dashboards.
Cons:
Complex Deployment: Managing deployments of multiple frontends can be complex.
Inter-application Communication: Handling communication and shared state between dashboards can be challenging.
Performance Overhead: Potential performance overhead due to multiple frontend applications.
Monolithic Application Approach:
Pros:
Simplicity: Simple project structure and build configuration.
Single Deployment: Only one deployment process to manage.
Shared Resources: Shared configurations, components, and logic are naturally available.
Cons:
Scalability Issues: Harder to scale specific parts of the application independently.
Codebase Size: The codebase can become large and difficult to manage.
Maintenance Challenges: Maintaining a large monolithic codebase can be cumbersome.
Coupling: High degree of coupling between different parts of the application.
Consequences:
Positive:
Monorepo: Facilitates collaboration and code reuse, ensuring consistency across the project.
Microfrontend: Provides flexibility and scalability, allowing independent development and deployment.
Monolithic: Simplifies deployment and shared resource management.
Negative:
Monorepo: May face issues with repository size and build times as the project grows.
Microfrontend: Introduces complexity in deployment and inter-application communication.
Monolithic: Scalability and maintenance can become significant challenges.
Decision:
After evaluating the pros and cons, we have decided to adopt the Monorepo approach. This approach provides a balance between code reuse, consistency, and collaborative development, aligning with our project goals and future expansion plans. While it may introduce some complexity in managing the repository, the benefits of shared resources and simplified dependency management outweigh the drawbacks.
Alternatives Considered:
Microfrontend: Offers high flexibility and scalability but introduces complexity in deployment and inter-application communication.
Monolithic: Simplifies deployment but poses significant challenges in scalability and maintenance as the project grows.
