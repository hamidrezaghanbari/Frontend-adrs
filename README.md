This repository contains a detailed Architecture Decision Record (ADR) document for frontend development in the General Purpose Frontend Project. The ADR outlines key architectural choices, their rationale, and the trade-offs considered to optimize the frontend architecture and ensure best practices are followed. This documentation serves as a reference for current and future contributors to understand the context behind critical decisions made for the project.
